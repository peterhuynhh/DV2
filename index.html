<h1 style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">The State of Employment in Australia: Trends in Unemployment, Wages, and Labour Participation</h1>
<body>
<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="unemployed_map"></div>
  <div style="margin-top: 10rem;">
    The map shows how unemployment per 1,000 population varies across Australian 
    states and territories across different years. For instance in 2024, Western Australia
    have tended toward higher unemployment densities compared to more populous states like New South Wales or Victoria. 
    This geographic pattern highlights how labour-market outcomes can differ and could be influenced by local industry mix (e.g., mining vs services), 
    demographic pressures and migration flows.
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="unemployed_line"></div>
  <div>
The general pattern shows a decline from the pandemic peak in 2020, followed by minor fluctuations and some slight upticks in 2023 before stabilising.
 That implies recovery momentum, but also that not all states progress uniformly. 
 The employment-to-population reached a record high ~64.7% in 2024, and participation near 67.1% according to the National Labour Force.
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="year_change"></div>
  <div>
In the bar chart of year-over-year changes in total employment/unemployment, we 
see that some years saw larger employment gains, while other years were 
Overall, Australia’s labour market has been tight, yet stable. The official unemployment
 rate has hovered around 4 – 4.5 % recently, with strong employment growth under the current government.  
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="full-part"></div>
  <div>
This chart compares full-time and part-time employment across different years. 
It shows full-time employment recovering faster after the pandemic shock, while part-time roles have grown more slowly. 
This suggests the labour market isn’t only recovering, but returning to higher-quality employment. 
The national data show full-time employment for women recently reaching records, and overall employment rising 8.4 % over three years.  
For example, in December 2024 full-time employment in Australia rose to about 10,058,500 people, and part-time employment to about 4,515,300. 
 The difference of being a full-time and part-time worker matters. Full-time jobs often typically offer better income security, more hours, and stronger benefits. 
 The fact that full-time grew faster suggests the recovery is generating stronger labour-market outcomes compared to the rise of part-time or casual roles.
  Still, there will always be room for improvement for the labour-market.
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="labour_working"></div>
  <div>
A rising participation rate and a growing staff of employed people mean Australia is utilising its working-age population better. 
For example, participation reached ~67 % and employment-to-population ~64.5 % in 2024.  
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="gender"></div>
  <div>
The male–female unemployment gap is small and consistent with broader trends of rising female labour force participation in Australia. 
According to Trading Economics, participation rate recently hit ~67 %.
In December 2024, the participation rate for men was 71.3% and for women 63.0%.
 Over recent years, Australia has seen increased female participation which was catalysed by policy shifts.
 Still, employment-to-population remains higher for men (about 69% vs. 60% for women) in many states, suggesting there is still room for improvment to close the gender gap.
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="stacked"></div>
  <div>
The stacked bar chart reveals how long-term unemployment has evolved. 
Even with the drop of short-term unemployment, unchanging long-term unemployment may remain, which suggests structural issues. 
Australian labour market research shows employment rate is at record highs but attention remains on under-employment and structural barriers.  
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="heatmap"></div>
  <div>
This heat-map highlights how state and year combinations evolve — darker colours where unemployment was higher and lighter colours toward 2024. 
This visual demonstrates the convergence of unemployment across states over time, serving as a warning to states that are lagging behind.  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="line_wage"></div>
  <div>
This chart underpins the story that wage growth has strengthened post-2022, which supports labour market tightness and improves household incomes. 
National reports indicate wages rising modestly, and with low unemployment the pressure on wages increases.  
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:2rem;">
  <div id="bar_hours"></div>
  <div>
The chart of average weekly hours by industry in 2024 shows full-time roles being more prominent with higher hours which 
indicates a stronger demand for labour hours.
This aligns with strong participation and employment outcomes in recent years.
According to the ABS for December 2024, total monthly hours worked across all jobs reached 1,975 million hours. 
 Also, research underlines that industries such as mining and resources (in Western Australia and Queensland) saw higher average hours,
  driven by project demands and overtime, whereas sectors like retail and hospitality have shown more constrained hours growth, 
  often due to labour supply shortages.
  </div>
</div>

<hr style="margin-top:3rem; margin-bottom:2rem; border:1px solid #ccc;">

<div style="max-width:1000px; margin:auto;">
  <p>
    Overall, Australia’s labour market demonstrates strong resilience. 
    Employment levels not only recovered from the pandemic downturn but reached current record highs, 
    supported by strong participation and stable unemployment near 4%. 
    Wage growth and total hours worked both increased, though productivity and real income growth remain key challenges. 
    However, the differences in employment for different regions and industries still exist, with resource-rich states and full-time positions driving the majority of gains, 
    while certain service sectors and part-time workers continue to face slower gains.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the prominent strengths of Australia's employment include recovery, adaptation, and balance.
    Australia has largely succeeded in rebuilding its employment base while maintaining low unemployment, 
    however, we still require policies that sustain inclusive growth, enhance productivity, and address 
    the structural and geographic gaps that remain today.
